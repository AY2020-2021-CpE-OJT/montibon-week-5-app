Phonebook Application Task 5 Week 5: Secure API with JWT/Passport

Added header and the generated token to requests to access secured API

Updated UI:

Removed the delete and edit floating action buttons on display screen

Added search textformfield (non-functioning due to errors)

Repositioned the add contacts to appbar together with a vertical more icon for deleting multiple contacts (still not functioning)

Sorted the contacts alphabetically (first name basis)

On tap of cards/tiles directs to the update contact with a delete icon on the appbar

On hold of card/tile shows the delete alert dialog (goal is to allow selecting multiple contacts for deleting)
